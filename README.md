## Aperçu ##

This project is to create a modular game engine that accommodates a 2D side-scrolling tilemap platformer, and a game that runs on top of it.

The project is divided into two parts: **Terrarum the Game Engine** and **Terrarum the actual game**.

## Terrarum the Game Engine ##

This game engine aims to provide following features:

- Tiled lighting simulation with transmittance sim in full RGB and UV for fluorescence
- Corner Occlusion
- 2D Skeletal Sprite
- Built-in Mod support
- Simple AABB Physics
- Fluid simulation based on Cellular Automata
- Built-in multilingual font — please refer to [its own Repository](https://github.com/curioustorvald/Terrarum-sans-bitmap)

*Terrarum* is a side-view tilemap platformer-adventure-sandbox game.

## Setup ##

- Requirements:
    - JDK 17 or higher
    - IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
