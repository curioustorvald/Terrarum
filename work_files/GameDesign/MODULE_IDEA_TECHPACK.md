## Computers

- Instead of single box with bunch of parts, make computers occupy several blocks -- processor unit, core memory unit, storage unit (RAMAC!), I/O unit, etc., like old PDPs. Powerful computer == more space.
- Make portable units like TRS-80 Model 100.
- Proper virtual machine with finite RAM and its own virtual CPU with full (but simplified/high level emulation of real things) instruction set and registers
    - at least BASIC is must be supported
    - plus C compiler? Am I too ambitious?


## Electricity

If things would run with infinite energy, I'm out. We need realism to implement resource management which turns into a Fun! (for the most time)

- Direct Current (only! because AC makes EE 10x harder), follows Ohm's law, and EXPLOSION!
- Take 'some' idea from _IndustrialCraft_ (Minecraft mod)
- Solar Windows, blocks light bit more than regular windows, high energies are absorbed more (it's a real thing!!)

### Source of Electricity

- Conventional
    + Fuel burn
    + Nuclear fission
- (almost) Infinite
    + Dark solar panel (traditional panel)
    + Transparent solar panel (window panel)
- Capacitor
    + Battery pack
    + Pu-238 RTG (super long-lasting battery with radioactive taste)
