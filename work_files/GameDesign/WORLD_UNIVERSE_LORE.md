A chapter of the WORLD series


# Universe

## Shape

The world is cylindrical. (really it is -- the very shape is used to sample noises) It loops at left and right end. One of the in-game tapestry reflects this.


## Multiverse

Multiverse exists. On the main screen, players can only select a persona (user in Terraria), and the game loads the world where player saved the game.

Multiple maps are multiverse in this game; users don't have an access to the multiverse or concerning techs; only after hard play (and several deaths, possible) players can reach the technology and create the new universe (new world) where the player can exploit.

Let's be honest: when you play the Terraria bit heavily, you create multiple world to farm resources; this is cheat and you know it, which is why, in this game, you technically can but after hard working so that it'd be less of a cheat.

### New World (New Universe)

The teleporter also works as "world manager"; players can create new world or delete existing ones. Lore-wise, creation and deletion is regarded as linking and unlinking.

When players create a new world (by new multiverse or new persona), they can choose the size of the new world, and that and the name would be the only thing players can _control_.


### New Game

The only way to make a new game is to create new persona and thus, the game creates a new world for the first time. In single player mode, one persona cannot cross other persona's universes.
