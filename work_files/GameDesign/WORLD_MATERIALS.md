|Steel|Advanced tools/armours/weapons|
|Titanium|Lightweight and advanced (tools/armour)|
|Glass|Exotic tools/weapons|Between copper and iron|
|Aurichalcum|Advanced exotic tools/weapons|Between steel and titanium, heavy|
|Adamant something|TBA|More tough than being really hard, "advanced steel"|
|Tin|Advanced wood (makes furnitures and things)||
|Gold|Bling-bling, advanced electronics (semiconductor)|

TODO: if we can boil water, and can use it to produce electricity THEN add following

|Name|Usage|Remarks|
|----|-----|-------|
|Uranium|To boil water efficiently than lava|Uranium ore (to be specific, uranium oxide) has yellow colour; the metal has silver-grey colour|



### Weapon Tier

    Natural / Common  Stone -> Copper -> Iron -> Silver      ->        Titanium
    Forging                                -------------->  Steel  --------^
    Exotic ('elven')                 Glass                     Aurichalcum
    Special (something 'adamant')                                              ??? (Use material spec of CNT, tensile strength 180 GPa)

## Gemstones

Gemstones are used to decorate stuffs, or more usefully, give property to the tools/weapons, gems are imbued with some properties. (warning: magic ahead)

### List of Gemstones

|Name|Property|Remarks|
|----|--------|-------|
|Diamond|Prettier and shinier glass, great abrasive, ice/cold??|So does real-world diamond|
|Amethyst|Storm/Lightning (high voltage electricity)||
|Ruby|Fire|Beautiful colour|
|Sapphire|Water?|Beautiful colour|
|Emerald|??|Beautiful colour|
|Topaz|??|Couldn't produce _that_ beautiful colour :\|


### Gemstone tier

Topaz -> R·G·B -> Diamond·Amethyst

Gemstones go elemental?! (pretty generic but otherwise there are no motivations to willingly collect them...)

- Ruby: grants fire resist/boost
- Sapphire: grants cold resist/boots
- Amethyst: grants shock resist/boost
- *two left boy!*
