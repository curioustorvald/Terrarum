## Economy ##

Ref. How EVE Online's economy works and controlled

* Mobs/People can be killed, and they drop resources: THEY PRINTS MONEY.
* If players die, some of (50 %?) their items are lost, forcing them to spend their money and resources.
* Items break, also forcing them to spend money (see below:)

### Resource management ###

* Tools/Weapons have durability
    - And NOTHING IS INDESTRUCTIBLE (just cooldown time if they are "endgame" items, but not the weapon with highest damage -- see how Master Sword works in Zelda BotW)
    - Relevant UIs are completed, so no turning back --Torvald, 2017-04-22
