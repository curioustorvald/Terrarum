### Serialisation
- FluidType: Hashed list of BlockAddress, Int
- FluidFill: Hashed list of BlockAddress, Float32

### Notes
- By doing this, you donâ€™t need 16 blocks to represent a water; you only need 1 block for all kinds of fluids
- Storing the overfill (treat water as compressible) is important, will work as a temporary storage until the overfill is resolved, and rim of the update area will always be overfilled before they get updated
