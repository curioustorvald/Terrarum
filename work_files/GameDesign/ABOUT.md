## Friendlier version of Dwarf Fortress Adventure mode

- Yet lots of !!fun!! (wat that double exclamation mark!)
- You can build your own hamlet (Dwarf "Fortress" reference)
- You die, you lose "you"; the world will be there, some of your possession will be on the ground, but you got to start over by making new character from scratch
    - Unless you have built Resurrection Shrine, which you won't going to easily build it

    you build one and persuade existing people to move in) -> See Dwarf Fortress and Animal Crossing)
