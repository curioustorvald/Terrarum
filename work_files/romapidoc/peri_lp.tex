The line printer is a printer that operates on line basis. It only prints text in line-by-line, hence the name, on almost endlessly long roll of papers; it has no notion of page, it just prints. If you want some pages to keep, you must tear them out yourself.

Line printers do not work indefinitely; ignoring the obvious depletion of ink, belt for loading paper will be out of service on about 50 000 lines of printing, give or take a few, or paper will jam if the printer had struck with the unluckiness.
