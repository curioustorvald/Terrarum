The Keys library helps you with Input API to get key code by key's names, or identify a key code.

Notes on compatibility with ComputerCraft: although this library is ComputerCraft-compliant, but Numpads are \emph{not} supported whatsoever. \textit{Come on, it's not like everyone has or likes numpad on their keyboard.}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l l X}
	\textbf{\large Function} & \textbf{\large Return} & \textbf{\large Description}
	\\ \\
	\endhead
	keys.<key name: String> & int & Returns key code corresponds to the key name.
	\\ \\
	keys.getName(keycode: int) & string & Returns key name corresponds to the keycode.
\end{tabularx}

\section{Accepted Key Names}

\emph{NOTE: following sets are considered as the same keys.}

\begin{itemize}
\item leftAlt --- leftCommand

(leftAlt is often recognised as leftCommand on macOS)

\item leftControl --- capsLock --- backspace

(colemak key layout puts secondary backspace on capsLock, Happy Hacking Keyboard puts Control on the location of Caps Lock)
\end{itemize}
