# idst: ID_STRING, ALL CAPS

# tens: tensile strength (= ultimate stringth)
        ultimate stringth is technically a tensile strength, but I'm using it anyway because it's easiest to get the value from
								that, or DF's tensile fracture divided by 1000 (I think Toady and I are both using values posted on Wikipedia, e.g. Silver)

# impf: Dwarf Fortress impact fracture divided by 1000 (likely not being used)

# dsty: density (grams per litre)

# fmod: forcemod -- related to attack points
#   Attack points = `4 * forcemod.sqrt()` for each strike

# endurance: multiplier, using copper as reference; determines durability of tools/weapons/armours/etc.
             the base value for endurance differes to tool to tool. When integer is used, resulting value must be ROUNDED.

# tcond: thermal conductivity

# Comments: do nothing; do not parse


## These values are being used by the phys simulator (blocks) and for attack power calculation (items)
