# Dependency syntax: "module name space allowed 444.44+"
# Version number: + means equal or higher, ! means this exact number, - denotes interval, * is wildcard
#                 the default is equal or lower
# e.g.  1.4+   would allow 1.4, 0.6, 1.13, 1.42, 1.4.0, 1.4.4456
# e.g.  10+.2  would allow 10.2, 10.1, 11.0 but would not allow any integer version (v10.0 != v10)
# e.g.  10.4!  would allow 10.4, 9.4, 8.4, 7.4
# e.g.  10.3-11.4 would allow 10.3, 10.7, 10.12676, 11.0, 11.4 but not integer v11, 10.3.12 etc.
# e.g.  13!.5  would allow 13.0, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4 and 13.5
# e.g.  *      would allow any version possible
# e.g.  *.*    would allow any version on that scheme
# e.g.  *!     would only allow all integer version
# NOTE: it's your responsibility that your mod's version scheme would not be a total mess!
# real world examples:
#       BaseGame 1.0+; CommandLineRenewed 2!.0+; Basegame 1!.0+; ScreenRecorder *; MyScrRecHack 1.*
