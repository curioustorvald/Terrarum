    <p>This style is controlled using the <code>cover</code> attribute on the root tag, with following values: <code>typewriter</code>, <code>printout</code>, <code>hardcover</code></p>

    <p>Typewriter and Printout are considered not bound and readers will only see one page at a time, while Hardcover is considered bound and two pages are presented to the readers.</p>
