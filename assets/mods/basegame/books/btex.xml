    <section>Full Control of the Shape</section>

    <p><index id="btex language" />With <btex /> you can fully control how your publishing would look like,
        from a pile of papers that look like they have been typed out using typewriter, a pile of printouts
        that have pictures in it, to a true hardcover book.</p>

    <p><index id="cover" />This style is controlled using the <code>cover</code> attribute on the root tag,
        with following values: <code>typewriter</code>, <code>printout</code> and <code>hardcover</code>.</p>

    <p>Typewriter and Printout are considered not-bound and readers will only see one page at a time,
        while Hardcover is considered bound and two pages are presented to the readers.</p>
