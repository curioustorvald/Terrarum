    <p>This is the first page of the Examination.</p>

    <p>Examination is a way to instruct the player certain gameplay concepts.</p>

    <p>The system is popularised by the Minecraft Mod called “Create”, of which it was called Pondering.</p>

    <p>Terrarum borrows the concept and implements it using its own language.</p>

    <p>Examination relies on the script written in <BTeX />.</p>

    <p><BTeX /> is a XML-like markup language to write texts to be displayed onto the game, one example being a book.</p>

    <p>Examination is a special format of the “book” that operates on the same book system.</p>
