# defines frame size and origin point. Origin point is given as: (originx, size.y - 1)
# ORIGINY is deduced from the sprite size as shown in above; you only need to set ORIGINX
CONFIG=SIZE 64,98;ORIGINX 40

# note to self: don't implement skeleton hierarchy: there's too many exceptions
# besides, you have "ALL" key.

! a skeleton also defines what body parts (images) be used.
! you can also write multiline text using reverse solidus; this is a feature of .properties
! skeleton joints are ordered: foremost-drawn object comes first, which means lowermost object IN THIS LIST
!   are painted first, and any object that comes before it will paint over it. In other words, this list is
!   first reversed then being iterated.
! Joints' original point is defined in the document sprite_joints.psd. It also has visual representations.
# TODO right now accessory points are explicitly defined. Should they be injected in run-time?
