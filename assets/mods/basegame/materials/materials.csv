# idst: ID_STRING, ALL CAPS
#
# tens: tensile strength (= ultimate stringth)
#       not all 'impact' is not tensile stress, but I'm using it anyway because it's easiest to get the value from.
#							that, or DF's tensile fracture divided by 1000 (I think Toady and I are both using values posted on Wikipedia, e.g. Silver)
#
# impf: Dwarf Fortress impact fracture divided by 1000 (likely not being used)
#
# dsty: density (grams per litre)
#
# fmod: forcemod -- related to attack points
#       Attack points = `16 * forcemod.sqrt()` for each strike
#
# endurance: multiplier, using copper as reference; determines durability of tools/weapons/armours/etc.
#            the base value for endurance differes to tool to tool. When integer is used, resulting value must be ROUNDED.
#
# tcond: thermal conductivity
#
# Comments: do nothing; do not parse
#

## These values are being used by the phys simulator (blocks) and for attack power calculation (items)
