Air tile (tile 0,0) must have colour of 0x00000000, NOT 0xFFFFFF00. You can modify the tga file directly to correct bad exporter behaviour.

Semitransparency is rendered using dithering, so it is good idea to avoid them.

If you must add semitransparency to the tile, they must have alpha NOT premultiplied.
