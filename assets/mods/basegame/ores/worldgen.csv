# id: ore ID to spawn, the ID must exist on the ores.csv
#
# freq: frequency value used to set up noise generator. Larger = ore veins are closer together
# power: power value (as in: randomNumber ^ power) used to set up the noise generator. Larger = veins are larger as you go deeper. 0.01 almost negates this effect
# scale: scale value used to set up the noise generator. Larger = thicker veins. A valid value tend to play around the 0.5; you'll need figure out this value by trial and error
# ratio: how elongated (or squeeze) the ore veins are. >1.0 = stretched horizontally, <1.0 = stretched vertically
#
# tiling: determines how the tiles are tiled
#   - a16: use 4-neighbour autotiling (16 possible cases)
#   - a16x4: 4 variants of a16 (typically 4 rotations, or 2 rotations x 2 flips)
#   - a16x8: 8 variants of a16 (typically 4 rotations x 2 flips) -- horz/vert flip do not matter, both produces same sets of shapes
#   - a16x16: 16 variants of a16 (typically 4 rotations x 2 flips x 2 styles)
#   - a47: use 8-neighbour autotiling (47 possible cases)
#   - a47x4: 4 variants of a47 (typically 4 rotations, or 2 rotations x 2 flips)
#   - r16: use the hash of the tile position as a variant selection, module 16
#   - r8: use the hash of the tile position as a variant selection, module 8
