Copper: Hue 33,
Copper rust: Hue 160
Iron rust: Hue 21


* Size variation

Race base weapon/tool size <- 10 [kg]
Size tolerance <- (50% * str/1000), or say, 20%

If the size is bigger than tolerable, weapon speed severely slows down, tools become unusable
    if use time >= 0.75 second, the weapon/tool cannot be equipped.
Small weapons gains no (dis)advantage, tools become unusable

Crafted tool/weapon size is dependent on the baseRaceMass.
